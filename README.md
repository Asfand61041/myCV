## Research Projects
Modeling climate change effects on the establishment of the invasive *L. delicatula*
*Spring 2022 - Current*

My project takes data science approach to tackle a biological issue. Invasive species are increasingly prevalent, and a massive amount of data has been compiled about invasion trends, so techniques need to be developed to utilize these biological datasets. I use the machine-learning software “MaxEnt” to make predictions about the risk of spread for L. delicatula, both currently and under climate change. I am developing this invasion prediction framework into an R package and website that will be freely distributed.
